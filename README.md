## Description

The Challenge for Module #13 asked us to refactor existing code in order to create routes for an ecommerce website. We were tasked with creating models based on specific criteria, and writing routes to display the information in the given database.

## Usage

This app does not have a front-end, and therefore no real user interface. It is best to download and seed the database, and then run the routes through Insomnia or your favorite API development platform.


## Challenges

My biggest challenge in working on this project was actually working with the code we were given to start the process. The Create Product route was given to us as part of the curriculum, and was the hardest code for me to decipher and work with.



## Credits

Initial source code and assets were provided through the University of Texas at Austin Bootcamp, and was provided in the challenge documentation itself.

Tutor Dru Sanchez provided guidance, as did TA Ian Darland in office hours.
